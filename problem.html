    <h1>Sleep and Health</h1>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>We want to investigate how lack of sleep affects the body physically and mentally, the connection between illness and lack of sleep, and why teenagers need more sleep than others. Many individuals, including children, youth, and the elderly, do not get enough sleep for their daily lives, impacting their cognitive functions and clarity of thought.</p>

    <h2>Impact of Sleep Deprivation</h2>
    <p>Sleep is crucial for various aspects of human life. Lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, impaired thinking, memory issues, reduced functionality, decreased focus, and increased stress levels. Additionally, sleep deprivation can affect mood, leading to irritability, sadness, and quick escalation of stress.</p>

    <h2>Excess Sleep Explanation</h2>
    <p>Sleep needs vary among individuals, but teenagers generally require 8-9 hours of sleep per day. Too much sleep can result in memory problems, difficulty concentrating, and mood swings, similar to the effects of insufficient sleep.</p>
    <p>Can one sleep too much? Find the answer <a href="https://example.com">here</a>!</p>

    <h2>How Does Sleep Affect Health?</h2>
    <p>Sleep is vital for body recharge and mind clearance, preparing for a new day with fresh thoughts. Since one-third of life is spent sleeping, it should be a positive experience as the other two-thirds depend on adequate sleep.</p>

    <h2>Why is Sleep Important?</h2>
    <p>Sleep is crucial for the body's regeneration and mental preparation for a new day. The mind empties itself of impressions during sleep, making room for new thoughts. With one-third of life spent sleeping, the quality of sleep is crucial for overall well-being.</p>
